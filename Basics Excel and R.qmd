## **Basics to Get Started: Excel and R**

Excel and R play different but complementary roles in a reproducible data workflow.

**Excel** is often the entry point for data collection and initial review. It is useful for entering data, performing quick checks, and sharing information in a familiar format. When structured carefully, Excel files can function as reliable sources of raw data.

**R** is used to perform analysis, summarization, and visualization in a way that is transparent and repeatable. Rather than relying on manual steps, R uses code to document exactly how data are filtered, grouped, summarized, and displayed. This allows the same analysis to be run again with new data, such as a new term or academic year.

Getting started does not require advanced technical setup. A basic workflow includes:

-   A well-structured Excel file that behaves like a data frame

-   An R environment for running analysis code

-   A clear separation between raw data and analysis outputs

In this guide, Excel is treated as a data source rather than the primary analysis tool. R is introduced gradually as a way to make common programmatic questions easier to answer, easier to update, and easier to explain to others.

The goal is not to replace Excel entirely, but to use each tool where it is most effective.

| When Excel is used as a data source for analysis, the goal is to ensure the file behaves like a data frame. | R is used to read, analyze, and summarize the data prepared in Excel.                                    |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| -   Use a clear, descriptive file name                                                                      | -   Set a working directory so R knows where to find your data files                                     |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| -   Store the file in a consistent folder so it can be easily accessed from the R environment               | -   Import the Excel file as a data frame                                                                |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| -   Keep one header row with concise, meaningful column names                                               | -   Use scripts to document data cleaning and analysis steps                                             |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| -   Avoid merged cells, blank rows, or blank columns                                                        | -   Separate raw data from analysis outputs                                                              |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| -   Do not use conditional formatting or color to encode meaning                                            | -   Rerun the same code when new data are added rather than recreating analyses                          |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| -   Ensure each row represents one observation (for example, one student, one exam, or one cohort)          | This setup allows the same analysis to be repeated across terms or years with minimal additional effort. |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| -   Ensure each column represents one variable (for example, term, pathway, campus, or score)               |                                                                                                          |
|                                                                                                             |                                                                                                          |
| These practices make the data easier to import, analyze, and reuse without manual cleanup.                  |                                                                                                          |
