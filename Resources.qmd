## Download R and R Studio

R is the programming language that performs the data analysis. It does the actual work of reading data, running calculations, and creating summaries and visualizations. R is free and open source.

RStudio is a user-friendly interface that makes working with R easier. It provides a space to write and run code, view data, and see results all in one place. RStudio does not replace R; it runs on top of it.

Both are needed. R provides the analytical engine, and RStudio provides the environment that makes using R accessible.

To get started:

-   Download and install **R** from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

-   Download and install **RStudio Desktop** after R is installed

Once installed, RStudio will automatically connect to R, allowing you to begin working with data without additional setup.

## GitHub

GitHub is a platform used to store, share, and collaborate on code. It allows you to keep track of changes to your analysis scripts, revisit earlier versions, and share your work with others in a clear and organized way.

You do not need to use GitHub to get started with R or to follow this guide. However, as your comfort with coding grows, GitHub becomes a useful tool for sharing reproducible workflows, collaborating with colleagues, and maintaining a record of how analyses evolve over time.

In this guide, GitHub is introduced as a future option rather than a requirement. Learning to write clear, well-documented code comes first. Version control and sharing tools can be added gradually as they become useful.
